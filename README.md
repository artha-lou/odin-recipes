# odin-recipes
This is the first official project of the Odin Project. This project is called recipes, and the purpose of the project is for the user to demonstrate their skill in basic HTML coding. 

By the end of this project, the following learning objective should be demonstrated:
- The ability to create a website of locally linked pages.
- The ability to add photos to the website.
- The ability to add script and a basic structure to a website.

This activity provides the user the creativity to pursue what recipes they would like to demonstrate. This project will be further built upon, so please keep that in mind as you complete your code.
