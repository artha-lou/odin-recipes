        <h3>Decription</h3>
        <p>This recipe is not for the faint of heart, oh no it's not. You must go to the Evil Forest and collect the rare Crystal Gem Apple in order to make my saweet sweet Apple Pie the way it's supposed to be made. If that's no possible, then I reccomend that you use Granny Smith Apples instead, but I do so strongly discourage this. At the end of the journey, you should have yourself a wonderful sweet buttery Apple Pie! Mr. Pig just does so love it so much! heh heh heh</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>For this recipe you will need the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pie Crust (I like making mine, but you can always source some from the Candy Kingdom)</li>
            <li>2 sticks of the good Irish Butter from those well treated cows</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of Cinnamon</li>
            <li>Extra Dough for the top</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of Lemon Juice</li>
            <li>1 cup of Brown sugar, and a little extra white sugar</li>
            <li>.25 cups of Flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the crust. You want to prep your pie bottoms by pre-baking in the oven at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes. If you have pie weights, you should utilize that in this step. This step is necessary for the crust to not be a soggy mess when we put our filling in.</li>
            <li>Once the crust is done baking, preheat the oven to 400 degrees.</li>
            <li>Prepare the apples. This step is crucial. Peel the skin off of each apple, slice the apple in 12 equal parts, and toss the slices into ice water. The ice water is necessary to prevent oxidization of the apples.</li>
            <li>Prepare the filling. In a small pot, we will combine the Cinnamon, Lemon, Sugar, slick Apples, and a quarter stick of Butter. Simmer on low medium heat until the apples are fork tender.</li>
            <li>Prepare the glaze and filling. In another small pot, melt the rest of the butter. DO NOT BROWN THE BUTTER IN THIS STEP. Once the butter is fully melted, combine the butter with the filling from the previous step. Make sure to stir every couple of minutes to prevent burning.</li>
            <li>Baking. Now that the filling and crust are fully prepped, we can combine them. Place the filling inside the baked crusts. To make the beautiful image of Tree Trunks, simply roll out the extra dough on a floured surface, and cut out the perfect image. Place this over your pie. Now bake your pie in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the top of the pie is a golden brown.</li>
            <li>Voila! You have yourself a pie procured from the apples of the Evil Forest! Well done well done! I personally like to enjoy my pie with a heaping scoop of vanilla ice cream, but enjoy it however you like!</li>
