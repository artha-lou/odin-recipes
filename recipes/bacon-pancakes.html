        <h3>Decription</h3>
        <p>Hi! My name is Jake and this is one of the classic breakfasts that Finn and I always eat! You know how it is, if I'm not making Finn cakes than you can catch me in the kitchen flipping some Bacon Pancakes with BMO. Sing the song (you know exactly what song) is a MUST when making these. All ingredients can be sourced from your local grocer, as this recipe does not have the same integrity as the PERFECT sandwich that I have also been known to make. Have fun!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>For this recipe you will need the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1.5 tsps baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>3 tbsp white sugar</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/3 pound applewood smoked bacon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat up your skillet over low medium heat. Once the pan is hot, add your bacon. Cook until crispy, then dice and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking power, baking soda, salt). Whisk to ensure thorough mix of dry ingridients.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, combine we ingredients (eggs, buttermilk, melted butter). Whisk together until homogenous.</li>
            <li>Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. Mix thoroughly so that there are no longer any clumps in the batter.</li>
            <li>Heat up the same skillet that you used to cook your bacon, which should still contain the bacon grease. This grease will add a nuanced perfecto flavor to the pancakes. Using a 1/2 cup measuring cup, ladel your batter into the pan. Allow the batter to fall straight from the top of the spoon to the skillet, creating a beautiful perfect pleasant natural circle.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle bacon, and be very generous, to the uncooked side of your pancakes in the skillet. Once bubbles start to form on the top of the pancakes, the pancakes are ready to be flipped. Let cook for another 2 minutes.</li>
            <lis>Continue with the remainder of the batter.</lis>
            <li>Congrats~! You have officially made yourself a batch of Jake's amazing bacon pancakes!!! Oh yeahhhh~</li>
